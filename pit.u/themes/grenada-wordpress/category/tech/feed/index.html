			<p>Models on their own are unreliable. Utterly pointless. Too often, we see misleading decisions being made from that spike in an excel line graph or the absolute value from a financial model. But models are only a simplification of reality. A reflection of history. A benchmark or an anchor for future predictions.<br><br>Models are powerful when they’re showcased in a story — contextualising the data from introduction, analysis and recommendations.I recently had drinks with a friend who works in investment banking we came to a simplified (overly simplified) conclusion that investment bankers and consultants do the same thing. We validate an opportunity by building a model around the future-state. This is the ground work. We then hook the deal by injecting industry insights, playing with variables of financial/operating models, and aligning proposed options with strategic objectives of the organisation.

So how do you turn a beautifully complex model into a compelling story?</p><br>
		</div>
	</div>
<h4>1. Buffer for assumptions and variances</h4>
	<div class="wpb_raw_code wpb_content_element wpb_raw_html" >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>If you haven’t built the model yourself, its well worth investing the time to understand its mechanics — i.e. what are the data sources and how are they applied to produce an output?

Ideally, most models should have a buffer in a range where a set of options might sit. A basic modelling principle which requires a thorough understanding of the quality of the data, the context of the business and how it might impact the overall result. For instance, you might apply a 20% contingency buffer to an opex forecast to factor incidentals, or use industry benchmarks for a valuation to include worst and best case scenarios around the actual value.</p>
                                
                                <p>There’s a clear story here. Adding a buffer to a model says this model isn’t perfect, but there’s a science to how we manage the downside of assumptions or variability in the data.</p>
                                <br>
		</div>
	</div>
<h4>2. Test alternate worlds</h4>
	<div class="wpb_raw_code wpb_content_element wpb_raw_html" >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			p>The fun with modelling is in playing with variables to produce different scenarios — be it changing prices, rates of return, stock variances, labor utilisation or even failed projects. You might do this with fancy Monte Carlo simulations (which I’ve never got right!), or manually change a model’s inputs to test its impact on the final outcome.<br><br>We create stories through these scenarios. How would the outcome differ if we canned a project half-way through its lifespan? What would happen if the price of wool suddenly skyrocketed up by 80%? What would happen if we acquired company Y instead of company X…or both?<br><br>Creating alternate worlds with our models allows us to make decisions about the risks we need to mitigate and the extent to which we might want to control variables depending on their relative impact.</p><br>

		</div>
	</div>
<h4>3. Clinch it with a business case</h4>
	<div class="wpb_raw_code wpb_content_element wpb_raw_html" >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>A model becomes meaningful when it inspires action. Action which comes from a decision. A decision which comes from seeing an opportunity that ties directly with a business and social need.<br><br>A model is ultimately used to make recommendations on a set of initiatives, drawing upon the vision and strategic intent of the enterprise. But it takes a lot to get to the final cut. It takes a deep understanding of factors that would disrupt the organisation internally, in the broader industry and how these factors translate to a problem statement and call for action.<br><br>The recommendations itself must tell a story through a solid business case. It tells us:</p>
                                
                                <ul>
                                	<li>Purpose and need</li>
                                    <li>Opportunity costs (of choosing one initiative of another)</li>
                                    <li>Risk mitigation</li>
                                    <li>Measuring performance</li>
                                </ul>
                                
                                <p>At the end of the day, the model is really only a small part of a pitch. The story is in the detail, the assumptions, the data sources and all the little nuances which contextualise its existence.</p>

			<p>At the moment we have a professor from the Maastricht University embedded in our design studio. He is studying designers in the wild like an anthropologist would study an unknown tribe in Africa. One of the subjects of his research is the design process. I always found this an interesting topic and this is what led me to Chimero’s book: it speaks about the design process from a designer's point of view. His insider's view is a feast of recognition. <br><br>What stuck with me the most about his description of the design process is the idea of clear thinking. Chimero has an interesting description of the way he works: he just “shows up” and lets the “context speak what it requires”. He says “it’s the designer's job to figure out a way to have the problem show it’s actual self so he can respond to the truth that has emerged.” This is clear thinking: to see the truth about the problem at hand.</p><br>

		</div>
	</div>
<h4>Philosophy</h4>
	<div class="wpb_raw_code wpb_content_element wpb_raw_html" >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>When we start asking why and start thinking about truth we enter into the domain of philosophy. I have always seen design (and other arts) as a visual form of philosophy. One that is more elaborate than traditional philosophy because it not only thinks through words but also through images. Some might call this particular form of philosophy design thinking. When we define design as a branch of philosophy, the next step is to question some of the great thinkers of this world to see what they have to say about design. For me, there are two philosophical texts by Martin Heidegger that define good design.</p>

			<p>There’s a clear story here. Adding a buffer to a model says this model isn’t perfect, but there’s a science to how we manage the downside of assumptions or variability in the data.</p><br>
		</div>
	</div>
<h4>The definition of a good website</h4>
	<div class="wpb_raw_code wpb_content_element wpb_raw_html" >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>Just like art, design is in constant need of definition. I think the answer to the question of what good design is, defines the designer. So, design is about asking why (so it’s basically philosophy), web design’s aim is to find the truth about the client, the user, and the internet, the truth is best communicated through beauty, to find the truth about your medium you have to forge a deep connection to it</p>

			<p>Big open work spaces allow teams to work closely, face to face. This makes collaboration seamless by enabling designers and other colleagues to rapidly iterate on ideas and get feedback by simply looking up and asking. Whiteboards are abundant so it’s easy and quick to engage in design thinking activities any time the need arises. Lounge setups provide comfortable and casual places to chat, review work, and of course share food.</p><br>

<h4>Determining the right layout</h4>
	<div class="wpb_raw_code wpb_content_element wpb_raw_html" >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<p>With a rectangular shape and limited square footage, figuring out how to arrange everything was a bit challenging. The plans went through a few iterations to find just the right balance of the versatile spaces that larger studios boast. The final design placed team desks parallel to the large glass wall, giving designers a nice view out of the studio and others a nice view of the design magic happening within. Breakout spaces and the more private meeting rooms were set along the back wall. The team moved in to the space in April and have been enjoying their new digs.</p>
